Fully Functional JS Calculator

Psuedo code/program theory

- 10 buttons for 0-9, 1 for ".", 4 operators intially "+ - \* /" and an "=" button, a C button to clear current value and a CE to clear all entered values
  -and a result screen most likely made of an array with the max value being 99'999'999 or 0.999999

basic operation should be
-number entered is saved as a value
-then when an operator is pressed it saves that value and which operator was pressed
-when the next number is entered and result pressed it takes the first result value and performs the operator on the second result
-it then results it again as a final value
-extra functionality could be performing another operation on the resulted value after first calculation has been made

number values entered as a string then converted once next function has been entered

number 1 entered as string using buttons -> operator button is pressed, number 1 string is converted to integer and operator type saved -> number 2 is entered as string using buttons -> result button pressed and number 2 converted to integer -> Number 1 (operation) Number 2 Output Result

number 1 value
number 2 value
operator value
